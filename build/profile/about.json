    "about": "University, should be Universal, I am basing my education in broad ranges, having a clear interest in robotics and space technology \n\n\n From breaking my mom's cherished jar while experimenting with FPV in my youth to diving into the intricacies of robotics at the University of California, Berkeley, my journey has been nothing short of a relentless pursuit of innovation. My name is Francesco, a dedicated junior majoring in EECS. The beauty of controlling aerial systems, especially in UAV applications, continues to inspire me. This passion has driven me to various ventures, from developing a water tracker application with Google to pioneering a B2C startup at the European Innovation Academy.\n\n\n Yet, as I embark on my academic and professional endeavors, ranging from research at Berkeley Haas School of Business to being a TA for EECS 16A, my commitment extends beyond just technology. I am proud of my contributions as a Regional Coordinator for TECHO, where we combated extreme poverty in South America. My multidimensional experiences, from 3D modeling rockets with Space Enterprise Berkeley to volunteering in marginalized areas, have shaped my vision. A vision where technology and human compassion intertwine to create a better future. As I continue to sharpen my skills and expand my knowledge, I am eager to leverage them to contribute more significantly, bridging the gap between technical innovation and societal impact.",
